# ControlCore [![Build Status][travis-ci-img]][travis-ci-link] [![Build status][appveyor-ci-img]][appveyor-ci-link]

Core control systems functionality for **analysis**, **design** and
**identification** tools to be implemented later on.

This repository is meant to provide a basic set of tools, *i.e.*, *transfer
function* and *state space* types as well as the basic mathematical operations
defined on them, in a way that other tools for **analyzing** or **identifying**
control systems would use the same set of functionality in a transparent,
coherent way.
